Problems?
=========

Please check:

 - Are you including the proper parameters?
 - Are you using the proper request type `POST` vs. `GET`?
 - Are you setting ``"Content-Type: application/json"`` in headers?
 - Getting redirected? Add a ``/`` at the end of the API endpoint!

If none of this resolves the problem, please contact support.
