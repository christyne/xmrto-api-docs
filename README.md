Abstract
--------

XMR.TO is a service that allows users to pay any bitcoin address
anonymously using Monero.
Monero is a secure, private, untraceable currency that is open-source
and freely available to all.
XMR.TO converts moneroj (XMR) provided by the user to bitcoins
(BTC), which are sent to a given bitcoin address.

XMR.TO provides an API that enables developers to use the service
in programs, apps, scripts etc. This API therefore allows developers
to integrate an option to pay any bitcoin address in their product,
for example, in a monero wallet service.
The API is a REST-like API using JSON as dataformat. It is available anonymously
and does not require identification or authentification.
This document describes this API and gives examples of its usage.
